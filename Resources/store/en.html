<div>View Snapshots is a plugin for shopware that allows you to record/log requests
    continiously. It will record snapshots of variables passed to the view and
    will persist them in serialized form to the database. Also persisted is the
    template path, session ID and steps taken since the start of recording.
</div>
<div><br></div><h2>Goal</h2>
<div>
    By having a snapshot of the template, including it's data, you can review most
    requests with the more or less exact same outcome as the original request.
    Therefore you can customize your templates, css, JavaScript and check your
    changes against a previously recorded situation, e.g. a variety of different
    articles within the basket or the order confirmation.
